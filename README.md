# Scipy.org Website Source Code
 
This repository contains the Sphinx source for the [SciPy website](http://www.scipy.org/).

After cloning this repository, run

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

to get the Sphinx theme used.

The source is in the `www` directory, `cd` there, then the following
commands apply:

To make a local build of the website

`$ cd www`  
`$ make html`

To build and upload the site (requires ssh access to www.scipy.org,
and if you're on macOS then upgrade rsync with Homebrew first):

`$ make upload USERNAME=myusername`  

To test external links from the site

`$ make linkcheck`
