**User questions:** The best way to get help is to post your question to
the [user mailing list](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/scipy-user@python.org/)
or a site
like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scipy), with
thousands of users available to answer. We wish we could keep an eye on
these sites, or answer questions directly, but the volume is just a little
overwhelming!

**Development issues:** For SciPy development-related matters (e.g. bug reports), please
see [Community](/community).



# [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scipy)

A forum for asking usage questions, e.g. "How do I do X in SciPy?‚Äù. Please [use the `#scipy` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging)
