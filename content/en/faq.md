## What is SciPy?

SciPy is a set of open source (BSD licensed) scientific and numerical
tools for Python. It currently supports special functions, integration,
ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers, gradient optimization,
parallel programming tools, an expression-to-C++ compiler for fast
execution, and others. A good rule of thumb is that if it\'s covered in
a general textbook on numerical computing (for example, the well-known
Numerical Recipes series), it\'s probably implemented in SciPy.

## How much does it cost?

SciPy is freely available. It is distributed as open source software,
meaning that you have complete access to the source code and can use it
in any way allowed by its liberal BSD license.

## What are SciPy\'s licensing terms?

SciPy\'s license is free for both commercial and non-commercial use, per
the terms of the BSD license
[here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

## How can SciPy be fast if it is written in an interpreted language like Python?

Actually, the time-critical loops are usually implemented in C, C++, or
Fortran. Parts of SciPy are thin layers of code on top of the scientific
routines that are freely available at <https://www.netlib.org/>. Netlib
is a huge repository of incredibly valuable and robust scientific
algorithms written in C and Fortran. It would be silly to rewrite these
algorithms and would take years to debug them. SciPy uses a variety of
methods to generate \"wrappers\" around these algorithms so that they
can be used in Python. Some wrappers were generated by hand coding them
in C. The rest were generated using either SWIG or
[f2py](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/index.html). Some of the newer contributions to SciPy
are either written entirely or wrapped with
[Cython](https://cython.org/) or [Pythran](https://pythran.readthedocs.io).

A second answer is that for difficult problems, a better algorithm can
make a tremendous difference in the time it takes to solve a problem.
So, using SciPy\'s built-in algorithms may be much faster than a simple
algorithm coded in C.

## I\'ve found a bug. What do I do?

The SciPy development team works hard to make SciPy as reliable as
possible, but, as in any software product, bugs do occur. If you find
bugs that affect your software, please tell us by entering a ticket in
the [SciPy bug tracker](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues).

## How can I get involved in SciPy?

Head to our [community](/community) page.
We are keen for more people to help out writing code,
tests, documentation, and helping out with the website.

## Is there commercial support available?

Yes, commercial support is offered for SciPy by a number of companies,
for example [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com),
[Enthought](https://www.enthought.com), and
[Quansight](https://www.quansight.com).

# NumPy vs. SciPy vs. other packages

## What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy?

In an ideal world, NumPy would contain nothing but the array data type
and the most basic operations: indexing, sorting, reshaping, basic
elementwise functions, etc. All numerical code would reside in SciPy.
However, one of NumPy\'s important goals is compatibility, so NumPy
tries to retain all features supported by either of its predecessors.
Thus, NumPy contains some linear algebra functions and Fourier
transforms, even though these more properly belong in SciPy. In any
case, SciPy contains more fully-featured versions of the linear algebra
modules, as well as many other numerical algorithms. If you are doing
scientific computing with Python, you should probably install both NumPy
and SciPy. Most new features belong in SciPy rather than NumPy.

## How do I make plots using SciPy?

Plotting functionality is beyond the scope of SciPy, which
focus on numerical objects and algorithms. Several packages exist that
integrate closely with SciPy to produce high quality plots,
such as the immensely popular [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org). Other
popular options are [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest),
[Plotly](https://plot.ly) and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io).

## How do I make 3D plots/visualizations using SciPy?

Like 2D plotting, 3D graphics is beyond the scope of SciPy,
but just as in the 2D case, packages exist that integrate with SciPy.
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) provides basic 3D plotting in the
`mplot3d` subpackage, whereas
[Mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) provides a wide
range of high-quality 3D visualization features, utilizing the powerful
[VTK](https://www.vtk.org/) engine.

## Why both `numpy.linalg` and `scipy.linalg`? What\'s the difference?

`scipy.linalg` is a more complete wrapping
of Fortran [LAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/) using
[f2py](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/index.html).

One of the design goals of NumPy was to make it buildable without a
Fortran compiler, and if you don\'t have LAPACK available, NumPy will
use its own implementation. SciPy requires a Fortran compiler to be
built, and heavily depends on wrapped Fortran code.

The `linalg` modules in NumPy and SciPy
have some common functions but with different docstrings, and
`scipy.linalg` contains functions not
found in `numpy.linalg`, such as functions
related to [LU
decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition) and the
[Schur
decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_decomposition),
multiple ways of calculating the pseudoinverse, and matrix
transcendentals, like the [matrix
logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm_of_a_matrix). Some
functions that exist in both have augmented functionality in
`scipy.linalg`; for example,
`scipy.linalg.eig` can take a second
matrix argument for solving [generalized eigenvalue
problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_eigenvalue_problem).

# Python version support

## Do NumPy and SciPy still support Python 2.7?

The last version of NumPy to support Python 2.7 is NumPy 1.16.x. The
last SciPy version to do so is SciPy 1.2.x. The first release of NumPy
to support Python 3.x was NumPy 1.5.0. Python 3 support in SciPy was
introduced in SciPy 0.9.0.

## Does SciPy work with PyPy?

In general, yes. Recent improvements in [PyPy](https://pypy.org) have
made the scientific Python stack work with PyPy. Since much of SciPy is
implemented as C
extension modules, the code may not run any faster (for most cases it\'s
significantly slower still, however, PyPy is actively working on
improving this). As always when benchmarking, your experience is the
best guide.

## Does SciPy work with Jython or C\#/.NET?

No, neither is supported. Jython never worked, because it runs on top of
the Java Virtual Machine and has no way to interface with extensions
written in C for the standard Python (CPython) interpreter.

Some years ago, there was an effort to make NumPy and SciPy compatible
with .NET. Some users at the time reported success in using NumPy with
[Ironclad](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ironclad) on 32-bit
Windows. Lastly, [Pyjion](https://pyjion.readthedocs.io/) is a new project which
reportedly could work with SciPy.

In any case, these runtime/compilers are out of scope of SciPy and not
officially supported by the development team.
