We would like to make it easy for you to include the SciPy project identity in your next academic paper, course materials, or presentation.

You will find a high-resolution version of the SciPy logo [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy.org/blob/main/static/images/logo.svg). Note that by using the scipy.org resources, you accept the [SciPy Code of Conduct](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html).
