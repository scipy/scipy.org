SciPy is a community-driven open source project developed by a diverse group of
[contributors](/teams/). The SciPy leadership has made a strong commitment to
creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the
[SciPy Code of Conduct](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html)
for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community
thrive.

We offer several communication channels to learn, share your knowledge and
connect with others within the SciPy community.

## Participate online

The following are ways to engage directly with the SciPy project and community.
_Please note that we encourage users and community members to support each
other for usage questions - see [Get Help](/gethelp)._

### [SciPy community meetings](https://scientific-python.org/calendars/)

SciPy community meetings are ideal to anyone wanting to contribute to SciPy
or just know how current development is going. You can follow
[our community calendar](https://scientific-python.org/calendars/) from your
preferred calendar manager, or look out for the announcements on our mailing
list.

### [SciPy new contributor meetings](https://scientific-python.org/calendars/)

Once a month we have special meetings for folks who want to start contributing
or have just started. All are welcome! Check our community calendar for details,
or look out for the announcements on our mailing list.

### [SciPy mailing list](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/scipy)

This list is the main forum for longer-form discussions, like adding new
features to SciPy, making changes to the SciPy Roadmap, and all kinds of
project-wide decision making. Announcements about SciPy, such as for releases,
developer meetings, sprints or conference talks are also made on this list.

A searchable archive of the old mailing list
is available [here](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/scipy-dev@python.org/).

### [SciPy Slack space](https://join.slack.com/t/scipy-community/shared_invite/zt-1a76bomjr-fuS1ZTnmP7b32kIhLb6QMg)

The SciPy team also has a Slack space that you can join. This is not a user
support forum, but you can ask questions about contributing and getting involved
in the community. To join, please [follow this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/scipy-community/shared_invite/zt-1a76bomjr-fuS1ZTnmP7b32kIhLb6QMg).

### [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues)

- For bug reports (e.g. "`np.arange(3).shape` returns `(5,)`, when it should return `(3,)`");
- documentation issues (e.g. "I found this section unclear");
- and feature requests (e.g. "I would like to have a new statistical test in `scipy.stats`").

_Please note that GitHub is not the right place to report a security
vulnerability. If you think you have found a security vulnerability in SciPy,
please report it [here](https://tidelift.com/docs/security)._

## Study Groups and Meetups

If you would like to find a local meetup or study group to learn more about
SciPy and the wider ecosystem of Python packages for data science and
scientific computing, we recommend exploring the
[PyData meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/pydata/)
(150+ meetups, 100,000+ members).

SciPy also organizes in-person sprints for its team and interested contributors
occasionally. These are typically planned several months in advance and will
be announced on the
[mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/scipy-dev.python.org/).

## Conferences

The SciPy project doesn't organize its own conferences. The conferences that
have traditionally been most popular with SciPy maintainers, contributors and
users are the SciPy and PyData conference series:

- [SciPy US](https://conference.scipy.org)
- [EuroSciPy](https://www.euroscipy.org)
- [SciPy Latin America](https://www.scipyla.org)
- [SciPy India](https://scipy.in)
- [SciPy Japan](https://conference.scipy.org)
- [PyData conferences](https://pydata.org/event-schedule/) (15-20 events a year spread over many countries)

Many of these conferences include tutorial days that cover SciPy and/or sprints
where you can learn how to contribute to SciPy or related open source projects.

## Join the SciPy community

To thrive, the SciPy project needs your expertise and enthusiasm. Not a coder?
Not a problem! There are many ways to contribute to SciPy.

If you are interested in becoming a SciPy contributor (yay!) we recommend
checking out our [Contribute](/contribute) page.
