The SciPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm! Your
choices aren't limited to programming -- in addition to

- [Writing code](#writing-code)

you can

- [Review pull requests](#reviewing-pull-requests)
- [Develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational material](#developing-educational-materials)
- [Triage issues](#issue-triaging)
- [Work on our website](#website-development)
- [Contribute graphic design](#graphic-design)
- [Write grant proposals and help with other fundraising](#fundraising)

If you're unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, _reach out!_ You
can ask on the [mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/scipy-dev.python.org/) or
[GitHub](http://github.com/scipy/scipy) (open an
[issue](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues) or comment on a relevant
issue).

Those are our preferred channels (open source is open by nature).

We also have a biweekly _community call_, details of which are announced on the
[mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/scipy-dev.python.org/).
You are very welcome to join.
If you are new to contributing to open source, we also highly recommend reading
[this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

Our community aspires to treat everyone equally and to value all contributions.
We have a
[Code of Conduct](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html)
to foster an open and welcoming environment.

### Writing code

Programmers, this
[guide](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/development_workflow.html#development-workflow)
explains how to contribute to the codebase.

### Reviewing pull requests
The project has hundreds of open pull requests -- meaning many potential
improvements and many open-source contributors waiting for feedback. If you're
a developer who knows SciPy, you can help even if you're not familiar with the
codebase. You can:
* summarize a long-running discussion
* triage documentation PRs
* test proposed changes


### Developing educational materials

SciPy's [User Guide](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/tutorial/index.html)
deserves attention.
We're in need of new tutorials, how-to's, and deep-dive explanations, and the
site needs restructuring. Opportunities aren't limited to writers. We'd also
welcome worked examples, notebooks, and videos.


### Issue triaging

The [SciPy issue tracker](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues) has a _lot_
of open issues. Some are no longer valid, some should be prioritized, and some
would make good issues for new contributors.  You can:

* check if older bugs are still present
* find duplicate issues and link related ones
* add good self-contained reproducers to issues
* label issues correctly (this requires triage rights -- just ask)

Please just dive in.


### Website development

We've just revamped our website, but we're far from done. If you love web
development, these
[issues](https://github.com/scipy/scipy.org/issues)
list some of our unmet needs -- and feel free to share your own ideas.


### Graphic design

We can barely begin to list the contributions a graphic designer can make here.
Our docs are parched for illustration; our growing website craves images --
opportunities abound.


### Fundraising

SciPy was all-volunteer for many years, but as its importance grew it became
clear that to ensure stability and growth we'd need financial support. [This
SciPy'19 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBTJD_FDVjU) explains how much
difference that support has made. Like all the nonprofit world, we're
constantly searching for grants, sponsorships, and other kinds of support. We
have a number of ideas and of course we welcome more. Fundraising is a scarce
skill here -- we'd appreciate your help.
