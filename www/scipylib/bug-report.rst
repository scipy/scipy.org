Bug Reports
===========
**Please help us by reporting any problems you find.**

NumPy and SciPy library make use of Github to do project management.
There, you can see what we are currently working on (Pull Requests),
as well as file bug-reports (issues).

1. Go to the relevant page:

   - `SciPy library pull requests <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pulls>`_

   - `SciPy library bug reports <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues>`_

   - `NumPy pull requests <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls>`_

   - `NumPy bug reports <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`_

#. On Github you need to register an account the first time you use it.

#. Make sure the bug hasn't already been reported.  Click on "Search"
   and type in some keywords to search for.

#. File your bug-report by clicking "New Issue" on Github.  For advice on
   how to provide a useful bug report see :doc:`../bug-report`.

#. Note that the bug trackers are mostly for actual bugs. If you want
   to propose an enhancement, then the mailing list is a better place
   to get feedback.


**Thank you for helping to make** SciPy **better!**
