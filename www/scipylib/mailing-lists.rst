NumPy and SciPy Project Mailing Lists
=====================================

The mailing lists are our primary community forum. This is where we
organize projects, announce new releases, plan future directions, and give and
receive user support.

**Searching a list** is a great way to get your questions answered without
actually signing up for a list. Follow the **Read/Search** link for a nice
interface from Gmane_. Or, browse the old fashioned 
way at the official **Archives** link.

To post to a list, you have to be on it. If you want to see **how much
traffic** a list gets, there is a chart on the Gmane page, or just go to the
list archive and take a look. You can opt to receive messages in digest form.
Groups of about 10 messages are sent in one email, with a table of contents at
the top. This reduces inbox clutter, but means you will get the messages with
a delay of up to a day. It is okay to post job ads for work involving
NumPy/SciPy and related packages if you put "[JOB]" in the subject.

We also have read-only mailing lists setup for NumPy and SciPy that
provide notifications of all version control checkins.

Mailing Lists

The following table lists the core NumPy and SciPy lists. Please see 
:ref:`before-you-post` to make sure that this is the right place to ask 
your question.

There is also an IRC channel ``#scipy`` on `irc.freenode.net <http://freenode.net/>`__.

.. _before-you-post:

Before you post
---------------

* Search the appropriate archives first (one way is to use the
  "Read/Search" links to Gmane below).  Though knowing what search terms 
  to use is an acquired skill, often it's easier than you think. Also 
  check the :ref:`faq-top` to see if your question is answered there. 
* Please make sure that you're posting to the right list. The NumPy
  and SciPy mailing lists should be used for questions relating to
  those two packages in particular (general questions about how to
  accomplish a scientific task in Python are okay, too). Questions
  about **matplotlib** should go to one of the matplotlib_ mailing
  lists. Questions specifically about using/developing the **IPython**
  shell should go to one of the IPython_ lists.  Making sure your
  question is going to the right list saves everyone time and makes it
  far more likely the right people will see (and answer) your question
  quickly.

A few points on mailing list etiquette:

* **Reply to list, not to sender.**
  
  In general it is not necessary to CC respondents on further replies to
  your thread. Please reply to the list rather than to the list *and* the 
  individual respondents (note that the NumPy and SciPy lists `add 
  Reply-To headers <http://www.metasystema.net/essays/reply-to.html>`_
  to facilitate this; normally, clicking 'Reply' in your mail client
  will direct replies to the list rather than the sender). Likewise,
  if you expect a reply, you should either monitor the list traffic 
  through your mail client or through a service like Gmane_; responses
  will generally be sent to the list and only the list.

* **Don't reply to digests.**
  
  Digests should only be used if you intend to read and not participate.
  Replying to digests makes it impossible to follow conversation threads;
  please subscribe normally if you wish to participate in the conversation.

* **Keep it friendly, folks.**

  Please keep the tone of conversations cordial and respectful, and 
  recognize that those responding to your questions are volunteering 
  their free time to do so.
