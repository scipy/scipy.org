=====================================
SciPy and NumPy project mailing lists
=====================================

The mailing lists are our primary community forum. This is where we
organize projects, announce new releases, plan future directions, and give and
receive user support.

To post to a list, you have to be on it. If you want to see **how much
traffic** a list gets, just go to the list archive and take a look. You can opt
to receive messages in digest form. Groups of about 10 messages are sent in
one email, with a table of contents at the top. This reduces inbox clutter,
but means you will get the messages with a delay of up to a day.

Please only post job ads if the work involves not only using NumPy, SciPy, and
related packages but an opportunity to contribute to these packages as part of
the role (we love to see that become more common!). If that's the case, please
put ``[JOB]`` in the subject.

We also have read-only mailing lists setup for NumPy and SciPy that
provide notifications of all version control checkins.

Mailing lists
-------------

The following table lists the core NumPy and SciPy lists. Please see
:ref:`before-you-post` to make sure that this is the right place to ask
your question.

StackOverflow
-------------
StackOverflow_ is a good place to ask usage questions. Tag your question
with ``numpy`` or ``scipy``, and with ``python``.

Usage questions can, of course, also be asked on the ``scipy-user`` or
``numpy-discussion`` lists.


.. _before-you-post:

Before you post
---------------

* Search the appropriate archives first (one way is to use the
  "Read/Search" links to Nabble above). Though knowing what search terms
  to use is an acquired skill, it's often easier than you think. Also
  check the :ref:`faq-top` to see if your question is answered there.
* Please make sure that you're posting to the right list. The **NumPy**
  and **SciPy** mailing lists should be used for questions relating to
  those two packages in particular (general questions about how to
  accomplish a scientific task in Python are okay, too). Questions
  about **matplotlib** should go to one of the matplotlib_ mailing
  lists. Questions specifically about using/developing the **IPython**
  shell should go to one of the IPython_ lists. Making sure your
  question is going to the right list saves everyone time and makes it
  far more likely the right people will see (and answer) your question
  quickly.

A few points on the mailing list etiquette:

* **Reply to list, not to sender.**

  In general, it is not necessary to CC respondents on further replies to
  your thread. Please reply to the list rather than to the list *and* the
  individual respondents (note that the NumPy and SciPy lists add Reply-To
  headers to facilitate this; normally, clicking 'Reply' in your mail client
  will direct replies to the list rather than the sender). Likewise,
  if you expect a reply, you should either monitor the list traffic
  through your mail client or through a service like Nabble_; responses
  will generally be sent to the list and only the list.

* **Don't reply to digests.**

  Digests should only be used if you intend to read and not participate.
  Replying to digests makes it impossible to follow conversation threads;
  please subscribe normally if you wish to participate in the conversation.

* **Use bottom-posting.**

  When replying to a message, please use bottom-posting. This means quoting
  the content you reply to and inserting your replies below each quote.
  For more details, see `posting style
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style>`_.

* **Keep it friendly, folks.**

  Please keep the tone of conversations cordial and respectful, and
  recognize that those responding to your questions are volunteering
  their free time to do so. The `SciPy code of conduct <scipy-coc_>`__ applies on
  SciPy lists and GitHub.
