Scientific Computing Tools for Python

SciPy refers to several related but distinct entities:

* The *Scipy Stack*, a collection of open source software for scientific
  computing in Python, and particularly a :doc:`specified set of core packages
  <stackspec>`.
* The *community* of people who use and develop this stack.
* Several *conferences* dedicated to scientific computing in Python - Scipy,
  EuroScipy and Scipy.in.
* The :doc:`SciPy library <scipylib/index>`, one component of the Scipy stack,
  providing many numerical routines.

The Scipy Stack
---------------

Core Packages
#############

* Python_, a general purpose programming language. It is interpreted and
  dynamically typed and is very suited for interactive work and quick
  prototyping, while being powerful enough to write large applications in.
* NumPy_, the fundamental package for numerical computation. It defines the
  numerical array and matrix types and basic operations on them.
* The :doc:`SciPy library <scipylib/index>`, a collection of numerical algorithms and
  domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization,
  statistics and much more.
* Matplotlib_, a mature and popular plotting package, that provides 
  publication-quality 2D plotting as well as rudimentary 3D plotting
* pandas_, providing high-performance, easy to use data structures.
* SymPy_, for symbolic mathematics and computer algebra.
* IPython_, a rich interactive interface, letting you quickly process data and
  test ideas. The **IPython notebook** works in your web browser, allowing you
  to document your computation in an easily reproducible form.
* nose_, a framework for testing Python code.

Other packages
##############

There are many more packages built on this stack - too many to list here. This
is a brief overview of a few major ones:

* Chaco_ is another Python plotting toolkit designed from the ground up to be 
  great for embedded, interactive plotting. It is built on Traits_, both are
  part of the `Enthought Tool Suite`_.
* Mayavi_ is a powerful and user-friendly framework for 3D visualization, 
  built on top of the award winning Visualization Toolkit, VTK_.
* Cython_ extends Python syntax so that you can conveniently build C extensions,
  either to speed up critical code, or to integrate with C/C++ libraries.
* Scikits_ are extra packages for more specific functionality. scikit-image_
  and scikit-learn_ are two of the most prominent.
* h5py_ and PyTables_ can both access data stored in the HDF5 format.
