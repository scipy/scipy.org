Report Bugs
===========
**Please help us by reporting any problems you find.**

Projects in the SciPy Stack all have their own bug trackers, on which issues
can be reported.  Questions and feature requests are best sent to the mailing
list of the project it concerns.  Trackers:

   - `NumPy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`_

   - `SciPy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues>`_
   
   - `Matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues>`_

   - `IPython <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues>`_

   - `Pandas <https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues>`_

   - `SymPy <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list>`_


Guidelines for submitting bugs
------------------------------

* Provide a good description. Tickets in the vein of "SciPy is
  BROKEN!!!" are not useful; rather, please state the problem clearly,
  e.g. "scipy.ndimage ignores keyword 'axis'".

* Include a minimal stand-alone code snippet to illustrate the
  problem.  Try to narrow it down to a few lines.

* If you experience segfaults or memory errors, give a GDB traceback:

      $ gdb python

      This GDB was configured as "i386-apple-darwin"...Reading symbols for shared
      libraries .. done
      (gdb) run -c "import scipy; scipy.test(10,10)"
      Starting program: /usr/local/bin/python -c "import scipy; scipy.test()"

  Then use the "bt" command after the segfault happens to get the backtrace.
  Alternatively, `run the code through Valgrind
  <http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/C_Extensions#head-9d3c4f5894aa215af47ea7784a33ab0252d230d8>`_.
