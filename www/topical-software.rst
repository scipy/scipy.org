It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS), while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries, except optionally for plotting support.
- `Python bindings for CLNUM <http://calcrpnpy.sourceforge.net/clnum.html>`__: a library which provides exact rationals and arbitrary precision floating point, orders of magnitude faster (and more full-featured) than the Decimal.py module from Python's standard library. From the same site, the ratfun module provides rational function approximations, and rpncalc is a full RPN interactive Python-based calculator.

Miscellaneous
=============

- These are just other links which may be very useful to scientists, but which I don't quite know how to categorize, or for which I didn't want to make a single-link category.
- `IDL to Numeric/numarray Mapping <http://www.johnny-lin.com/cdat_tips/tips_array/idl2num.html>`__: a summary mapping between IDL and numarray. Most of the mapping also applies to Numeric.

It can be used for searching, editing, reformatting, etc. In fact, it's a simple framework that provides easy-to-use `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ classes and functions, and therefore can be extended to many uses (generating HTML pages according to bibliographic searches, etc). In addition to the scripting environment, a graphical `Gnome <https://www.gnome.org/>`__ interface is available. It provides powerful editing capabilities, a nice hierarchical search mechanism, direct insertion of references into `LyX <http://www.lyx.org/>`__ and `Kile <http://kile.sourceforge.net/>`__, direct queries on Medline, and more. It currently supports the following file formats: BibTeX, ISI, Medline, Ovid, Refer.

- `Modular toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) <http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/>`__: a library to implement data processing elements (nodes) and to combine them into data processing sequences (flows). Already implemented nodes include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), and Growing Neural Gas.
- `FiPy <http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/>`__: FiPy is an object-oriented, partial differential equation (PDE) solver, written in Python, based on a standard finite volume (FV) approach.

- `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__: SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 2D and 3D. It can be viewed both as a black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package which can be used for building custom applications. The time-demanding parts are implemented in C/Cython.

- `CNEMLIB <https://m2p.cnrs.fr/sphinxdocs/cnem/>`__ : proposes an implementation of CNEM in 2D and 3D. The CNEM is a generalisation for non-convex domain of the Natural Element Method. It's a FEM-like approach. The main functionalities of CNEMLIB are: i) interpolation of scattered data spread on convex or non convex domains with the Natural Neighbour interpolant (Sibson) in 2D, and the Natural Neighbor interpolant (Sibson or Laplace) or the linear finite element interpolant over the Delaunay tessellation in 3D. ii) a gradient matrix operator which allows to calculate nodal gradients for scattered data (the approach used is based on the stabilized nodal integration, SCNI). iii) a general assembling tools to construct assembled matrix associated with a weak formulation (heat problem, mechanic problem, hydrodynamic problem, general purpose problem) as such used with the Finite Element Method (FEM).
