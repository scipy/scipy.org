Science: basic tools
====================

These are links which cover basic tools generally useful for scientific work in almost any area. Many of the more specific packages listed later depend on one or more of these.

- SciPy: umbrella project which includes a variety of high level science and engineering modules together as a single package. SciPy includes modules for linear algebra (including wrappers to BLAS and LAPACK), optimization, integration, special functions, FFTs, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and others.
- `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`__ is the package SciPy builds on and requires as a pre-requisite.  It is a hybrid of both Numeric and Numarray incorporating features of both.  If you are new to Numeric computing with Python, you should use NumPy.
- `Numerical Python <http://numeric.scipy.org/>`__ and `Numarray <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray>`__: these packages are the predecessos for NumPy.  Numerical Python is now deprecated.  According to Perry Greenfield at STSCI which funded Numarray development.  It will be supported until about the end of 2007 (supported provided mainly by Todd Miller) while all code based on Numarray is ported to use NumPy.
- http://dirac. cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/ : another collection of Python modules for scientific computing. It includes basic geometry (vectors, tensors, transformations, vector and tensor fields), quaternions, automatic derivatives, (linear) interpolation, polynomials, elementary statistics, nonlinear least-squares fits, unit calculations, Fortran-compatible text formatting, 3D visualization via VRML, and two Tk widgets for simple line plots and 3D wireframe models. There are also interfaces to the netCDF library (portable structured binary files), to MPI (Message Passing Interface, message-based parallel programming), and to BSPlib (Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming). Much of this functionality has been incorporated into SciPy, but not all.

The python bindings are based on run-time type information, such that you can add your own C++ classes on the fly to the system with a one-liner and down-casting as well as pointer manipulations become unnecessary. Using RTTI keeps memory and call overhead down to a minimum, resulting in bindings that are more light-weight and faster than any of the "standard" bindings generators.
- `PAIDA <http://paida.sourceforge.net/>`__, a pure Python scientific analysis tool including `AIDA <http://aida.freehep.org/>`__ interface.

It can do total energy calculations, molecular dynamics, geometry optimization and much more. There is also a GUI and visualization tools for interactive work.

Signal processing
-----------------

- `GNU Radio <http://www.gnuradio.org>`__ is a free software development toolkit that provides the signal processing runtime and processing blocks to implement software radios using readily-available, low-cost external RF hardware and commodity processors. GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python programming language, while the supplied, performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating point extensions where available. Thus, the developer is able to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment. While not primarily a simulation tool, GNU Radio does support development of signal processing algorithms using pre-recorded or generated data, avoiding the need for actual RF hardware.
- `pysamplerate <http://www.ar.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/david/softwares/pysamplerate/>`__ is a small wrapper for Source Rabbit Code (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/), still incomplete, but which can be used now for high quality resampling of audio signals, even for non-rational ratio.

It uses libsndfile for the IO (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), which means many formats are available, including wav, aiff, HTK format and FLAC, an open source lossless compressed format.  Previously known as pyaudio (not to confuse with `pyaudio <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/>`__), now part of `scikits <http://scikits.appspot.com/>`__.

You can pass sound buffers as NumPy arrays of float32's to play (non-blocking). You can also create pure tones, square waves, or 'on-line' white or pink noise. All of these functions can be utilized concurrently.
